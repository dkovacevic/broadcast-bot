## How to Create a public Channel
 - Register as Wire Bot Developer via Don at: https://app.wire.com/?bot=don
 - Ask Don to create your public channel by typing: `create public channel`
 
## How does it work?
This bot channels messages posted to it in Admin conversation to all conversations that it is in.
In order to subscribe to a channel user should use the link: https://wire.com/b/[channel_name].
There is no limitation as in number of subscribers or number of messages. 
The Channel owner will be placed into Admin Conversation and everything that is posted there will be forwarded to Subscribers
Message can be: text, web page, picture (a url to jpg|png|gif), youtube link, soundcloud link ... 

## Channels vs. Groups
 - Unlimited number of subscribers/participants
 - Able to see the previous messages after joining the channel
 - Nobody except the Channel Admin can see the list of subscribers/participants
 - Only Channel Admin can see the messages posted by subscribers
 - Channel can be advertised and anybody can subscribe to it
 - Only Channel Admin controls who can join the channel and what is posted
 - Subscribers posting in a Channel is faster than posting in a big Group conversation
